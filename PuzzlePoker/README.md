Poker Terms:
-In poker, "stab" refers to making a bet or continuation bet (c-bet) on the flop after having raised preflop, especially when it's a bet designed to take down the pot uncontested, rather than a bet made for value. It often implies a semi-bluff or bluff, aiming to capitalize on opponents' perceived weakness or lack of interest in the pot.
